    "When dealing with variable-length input sequences in an RNN, you can use padding and masking techniques. Padding involves adding dummy values (usually zeros) to the shorter sequences to make them equal in length to the longest sequence in the batch. This allows you to create a fixed-size input tensor that can be processed by the RNN. Masking is then used to ignore the padded values during computation, ensuring they do not affect the results.\n",
    "For variable-length output sequences, you can use the same padding and masking techniques. However, in addition to masking, you may need to define a suitable stop symbol or a specific condition to determine the end of the output sequence during training or generation."

In data parallelism, the model is replicated on each GPU, and each GPU processes a subset of the training data. During the forward and backward propagation, the gradients are calculated independently on each GPU. Then, the gradients are synchronized across GPUs and the model parameters are updated accordingly. To distribute the training and execution across multiple GPUs, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch provide built-in functionalities for data parallelism."
