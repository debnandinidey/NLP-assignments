    "ans: Backpropagation through time (BPTT) is an extension of the backpropagation algorithm for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or networks with recurrent connections. It handles sequential data by unrolling the RNN in time, computing gradients across multiple time steps, and adjusting the network's weights and biases to minimize the loss function. BPTT allows the RNN to capture long-term dependencies in the data but faces challenges with vanishing/exploding gradients. Techniques like gradient clipping and advanced RNN architectures help address these issues."

On the other hand, exploding gradients occur when the gradients during backpropagation become excessively large. This can cause weight updates that are too large, leading to instability in the learning process and making it difficult for the network to converge. "
